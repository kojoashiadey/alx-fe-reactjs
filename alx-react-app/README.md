Here are **short notes on React**:

### üß† **React - Overview**

* **React** is a **JavaScript library** for building **user interfaces (UIs)**.
* Developed and maintained by **Meta (Facebook)**.
* Focuses on **component-based architecture** and efficient **UI rendering**.

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è **Key Features**

* **Component-Based**: UIs are built using reusable **components**.
* **JSX**: JavaScript + XML syntax to write UI code like HTML inside JavaScript.
* **Virtual DOM**: Efficiently updates and renders components by comparing changes.
* **One-Way Data Binding**: Data flows in one direction ‚Äî from parent to child components.
* **Hooks**: Functions like `useState`, `useEffect` to use state and lifecycle in functional components.
